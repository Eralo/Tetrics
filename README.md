A Tetris Game made in C#. Displayed using WPF

## What makes this project different ?

I wanted to experiment with C# and WPF with a Tetris project. It is greatly optimized and include most major features awaited for a tetris game, like the SRS and a levelling system. I also hope to make this project go way beyond.

## How to

Current settings are the arrows: left and right to move the piece, up arrow to rotate, down to soft drop.
X key is for inverse rotation, C for stocking piece and space for hard drop.
